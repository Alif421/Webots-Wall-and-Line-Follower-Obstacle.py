# How Robots Work
1. the robot starts from the starting place
2. The robot follows the line and follows the wall
3. at the first and second junction the robot will turn left
4. after that at the third and fourth fork the robot will go straight or stop for a moment if the signpost goes down and waits for the signpost to open then it will go back
5. the robot will finish and stop
